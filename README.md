# Sponta

### Description
Sponta is a platform that facilitates spontaneous excursions among friend groups. A user can post a trip their planning on taking (either the day of or the day before) along with the number of spots available and picture previews of the destination to a centralized feed where the user's friends can join the trip. Then once user initiates the trip the app will plot out a route using Google Maps. Finally, after the trip, the trip participants can submit their photos to the trip organizer to post as a photo album.

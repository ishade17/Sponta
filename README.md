## Overview
### Description
Sponta is a platform that facilitates spontaneous excursions among friend groups. A user can post a trip their planning on taking (either the day of or the day before) along with the number of spots available and picture previews of the destination to a centralized feed where the user's friends can join the trip. Then once user initiates the trip the app will plot out a route using Google Maps. Finally, after the trip, the trip participants can submit their photos to the trip organizer to post as a photo album.

### App Evaluation
[Evaluation of your app across the following attributes]
- **Category:** Social Networking
- **Mobile:** iOS
- **Story:** This app was inspired after my roomate was struggling to plan a last minute trip to Big Sur.
- **Market:** This app would be most used for young people (teens, college, 20s) because this is the age group that has the most group outings. People above this age have less spontaneous outings and are with their family.
- **Habit:** This app handles much of the job of assembling a friends and organizing group outings.
- **Scope:** This app includes many wireframes, using maps, adding photos to a feed, chatting. So it will definitely take the four weeks.

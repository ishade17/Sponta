# Sponta

### Description
Sponta is a platform to facilitate spontaneous group excursions among friends. A user can post their trip itinerary with a preview photo of the destination and the number of available spots to a centralized feed then the user’s friends can fill the spots by joining the trip. This platform is great if you’d like to organize a last-minute outing with friends and don’t want to go through the hassle of reaching out to lots of people individually and coordinating schedules. Furthermore, Sponta has a “public trip” option where users can post their trip to map where anyone in the area can join the trip. This feature is great if you’re new to a city and looking to make new friends or just learn your way around an area. Sponta is equipped with an intuitive UI and many helpful features like bookmarking trips you’re interested in or a dashboard of your upcoming trips.
